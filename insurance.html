					<h1>Insurance Analytics</h1>

					<p>Imagine...your brand new auto insurance product is taking the market by storm. One of your salesperson has sold millions in premiums and earned thousands in commissions. Things are good.</p>

					<p>Until you notice that policies sold by your star salesman have an average loss ratio of 150%. He's bleeding your reserves and you're paying him to do it!</p>

					<p>In another scenario, your underwriting manager exited a region because of insurgent attack news coverage. However, policies written in that region have a 30% loss ratio. Your competitors are profiting from your forfeited business.</p>

					<h2>Basically, lackluster data insights costs you real money!</h2>

					<p>Large and successful insurance companies around the world have one common trait: they transform raw data into meaningful information to enable them more effective decision-making. Companies that pro-actively utilize their data will dominate their industry and peers.</p>

					<p>How well did your life-policy perform in Southwest Nigeria from 2009 – 2011? What is your earned premiums and number of policies sold per broker? Which lines of coverage are trending up and which are trending down? Are your loss ratios affected by population density? Who are your most profitable accounts in each region? Highly effective insurance companies can answer questions like these at a moments notice.</p>

					<p>Our Business Intelligence (BI) solution can put the answer to these questions and more on your fingertips. You will get a data-hub containing a single version of all your data as well as dashboards and reporting tools to quickly view key performance indicators across your organization. You will not only get immediate return on investment, you will get a partner that understands insurance and that will collaboratively work to make your insurance company more successful.</p>
