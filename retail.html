					<h1>Retail Analytics</h1>

					<p>Ask yourself this. How many opportunities are you passing up by ignoring the details of your retail operation? Was the last uptick in sales due to your expensive promotion plan or was it due to seasonal demand? Which products typically sell out and when? What are the purchasing trends of your customers?</P>
